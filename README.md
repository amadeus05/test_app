# Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve.

This app works on technique wich is called Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve.
Users can add some information (for example: words) after adding some information the application starts count 
by the method of Ebbinghaus when next time to show to user notification with with the request to 
repeat that information was added.
Each word has 5 notification statuses. If a record reaching status 5 it is deleted from database
Each of the statuses has his own time interval acordingly to Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve. The interval is counted everytime the notification was shown.

Intervals:
1 New information's Learning

### Version info

This app was originally generated on Mon Mar 11 2019 20:48:54 GMT+0200 (Eastern European Standard Time) using Sails v1.1.0.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.16.6`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.16.6/lib/core-generators/new). -->



<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
